# Discord-Trivia-Bot
This is a bot for discord made with Java and the Javacord API. It is basically a "question-game" where users can ask questions and other people have to answer them. It also starts the "Officials" after a certain time, loading questions and answers from a .json file to let users answer them and get points.
